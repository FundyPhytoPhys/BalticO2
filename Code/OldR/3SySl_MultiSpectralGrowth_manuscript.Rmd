# Introduction {.unnumbered}
Note: What is the target journal and content for this assessment of spectral and O2 influences on growth of Baltic strains?
It could clearly hit some 'local' journal on Baltic coastal issues.
Is there potential for wider conclusions for a wide journal?

Functional analyses to complete the growth and pigment plots:

-Solisense light response curves under all five actinic light colours.
  So, for example, PSII ETR vs. colour and/or JVPSII vs. colour
    Needs Doug to implement new PSII ETR and/or JVPSII; on Doug's list.
    
-OLIS spectra could be deconvoluted to pigment pools at Days many repeats
  Possibly focus on achieved pigment pool after XX days; ecologically relevant
  Mixing rates? Eddy duration?....  Or just pick a baseline period
  Or achieved pigment pools from mid-exponential vs. stationary....????
  Or after so many rounds of cell division....
  
  Something to rationally motivate choices of what data are presented.
  
  Consider fitting growth rate vs. spectra with a function (or interpolate) to compare to JVPSII vs. spectra
  Is growth rate pattern mirroring JVPSII or do other factors intervene?
  
  With correct unit choices we can plot growth return on JVPSII (or on PSII ETR) across spectra....
  
  Use OLIS spectra to generate a* etc.
  a* is the achieved absorbance per unit chlorophyll
  a* can be across PAR or waveband specific
  
  Calculation is a bit confusing but we can work it out.
  
  Attempt to use O2 calibration to get absolute values for JVPSII...
  
  Doug tasks:
  -add JVPSII and new PSII ETR
  
  Sylwia tasks:
  Continue to plot data
  -OLIS import and plot representative spectra
  -consider OLIS deconvolution  (consult with Doug as needed; do not be stuck!)
 

  
  Use OLIS spectral deconvolution to express PE/PC as index of (Complementary) Chromatic Acclimation
 
  Experimental Work: 
  *Probably add low O2 for BA127R* 

# Material and Methods {.unnumbered}

## Statistical analysis {.unnumbered}
We used R [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2019] running under RStudio [@rstudioteamRStudioIntegratedDevelopment2015], using packages "tidyverse" [@R-tidyverse], "glue" [@R-glue], "googlesheets4" [@R-googlesheets4], "kableExtra" [@R-kableExtra].

# Results {.unnumbered}

Note:
Are there any validations of [O2] with optode for 'low O2'?
In remaining runs test achieved low O2 range
With Mireille we found wide variation in growth responses in tubes that were consistently ~< 5 µmol O2 l-1 compared to tubes that were ~ 20 µmol O2 l-1

i) Clear difference in growth response to spectral range
ii) Evidence for combined toxicity of O2 x 405 nm b/c growth faster under low O2 x 405 nm

# knitr::include_graphics(file.path("SySl_MultiSpectralGrowth_manuscript_files", "figure-html", "Multi_LogisticOD720.png"))

```

```{r GrowthRateDelta, fig.cap = GrowtRateDelta_cap, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8, echo = FALSE}
GrowtRateDelta_cap<- glue("Growth rate - Logistic Delta (MultiCulti)", .sep = " ")

```


Possibly interesting differences in patterns of fitted logistic growth rate vs. achieved absorbance after 7 days!
Possibly presentation approach is to present growth achievement over 7 days (or other window) rather than nominal fitted growth rate

Note: Figure Caption Numbering messed up in HTML
Avoid spaces in r chunk names for auto-numbering

Consider some XY cross plots and regressions among different metrics of chlorophyll for Supplemental results.
Use fitted linear model NOT the ggplot geom_smooth b/c we need to be sure that fitted models are actually based upon the presented data.

Cross plots of Pico cell counts vs. PAMAS and vs. OD750 etc.
  Possible discrepancy with results from Gdansk calibration curves from flow cytometer?

OLIS based PC/PE ratios; incomplete data from filters
PC/PE or PE/PC?
Also PC/Chl and PE/Chl?
