# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Oxygen is essential for the survival of organisms and regulates the global cycling of nutrients and carbon. Oxygen levels in the open ocean and coastal waters have declined over the past half-century due to human activities that increase global temperatures and nutrient release. These factors accelerated microbial respiration, reduced the solubility of oxygen in water, and reduced the rate of oxygen re-supply from the atmosphere to the ocean, resulting in significant biological and ecological consequences. Since the mid-20th century, ocean deoxygenation has become a critical change in marine ecosystems, affecting productivity, biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles. This ocean deoxygenation ranks among the most important changes occurring in marine ecosystems [xxxx]. Historical data link major extinction events to warm climates and oxygen-deficient oceans, suggesting that current anthropogenic activities could lead to widespread oxygen deficiency in the oceans within a thousand years. Over the past 50 years, the open ocean has lost about 2% of oxygen, and models predict a further decline of several percent by the end of the century, which could cause significant biogeochemical and ecological impacts. Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) in the open ocean have expanded to an area equivalent to the European Union, and the volume of oxygen-free water has quadrupled. But the paradox is that these areas, sometimes called dead zones, are far from dead [@breitburgDecliningOxygenGlobal2018].

Picocyanobacteria, the most abundant primary producers in marine ecosystems [@flombaumPresentFutureGlobal2013], exhibit remarkable adaptations to thrive in low oxygen environments, such as Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs), prevalent at depths in the ocean [@wongPhytoplanktonRequireOxygen2023]. These zones are characterized by exceptionally low dissolved oxygen concentrations, posing challenges for aerobic organisms. However, picocyanobacteria species have evolved diverse strategies to cope with these conditions. Picocyanobacteria, can perform photosynthesis under extremely low light and oxygen levels, utilizing specialized pigments and photosystems to capture and utilize light energy efficiently [XXX citations xxx]. Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted the role of specific genetic adaptations in cyanobacteria populations inhabiting OMZs, enabling them to tolerate and even thrive in oxygen-depleted environments [@ulloaMicrobialOceanographyAnoxic2012]. These adaptations encompass genetic modifications related to energy metabolism, antioxidant defense mechanisms, and cellular structures optimized for oxygen scavenging and storage. Overall, the occurrence and adaptation of picocyanobacteria to low oxygen environments are critical components of marine ecosystems, shaping their productivity and biodiversity in OMZ regions.

The aim of this work was to demonstrate the ecophysiological response of PC-rich and PE-rich *Synechococcus* sp. to different oxygen concentrations and colors of light.

# Materials and Methods {.unnumbered}

## Culture condition and experimental setup {.unnumbered}

Xenic cultures of  PC-rich (CCBA_077) and PE-rich (CCBA_127) *Synechococcus* sp. were obtained from the Culture Collection of Baltic Algae (https://ccba.ug.edu.pl/pages/en/home.php) XXXXTHIS SHOULD BE A CITATION I THINKXXXX. *Synechococcus* sp. strains were cultured in Tissue Culture Flasks (VWR International, Cat. No. 10062-872, PA, USA) and transferred biweekly to fresh f/2 media [@guillardCulturePhytoplanktonFeeding1975] prepared at a salinity of 8 PSU, reflective of their natural habitat. Pre-cultures were maintained in incubators set to full air saturated dissolved oxygen concentration of 250 µM, temperature of 22℃ with a light/dark cycle of 12 h and Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) of 10 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ with illumination from Philips Cool White F14T5/841 Alto, 14 watts, fluorescent bulbs.

Controlled growth experiments were performed using MCMIX-OD PSI Multicultivators (Photon Systems Instruments, Drásov, Czech Republic) set to 22℃. Each of 8 round bottom cylindrical glass tubes contained 75 mL of f/2 medium and 5 mL of growing pre-culture. These parameters allowed for exponential growth of the cultures from the beginning of the experiment, with little lag phase. Inoculation of culture tubes took place in the afternoon, with a period of low light and then 12 h darkness before a sinusoidal 12 h photoperiod cycle commenced at XXX (Give time) the following morning, with peak PAR of 180 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ reached at noon each day.  (IS THAT TRUE? DID YOU START PHOTOPERIOD at 06:00?XXX).  

Each tube was maintained under an individual combination of one of 7 spectral wavebands (centred at 405, 450, 470, 530, 620, 660, or 730 nm) and 2 dissolved oxygen concentrations (O~2~; 250 µM and 2.5 µM). Culture tubes were closed with a silicone inert silicone stopper perforated by an aeration input tube extending to the bottom of the culture tube, and a pressure outlet tube. We used aeration with a total gas flow rate of around ~ 140 mL min^−1^ tube^−1^ through a 0.2µm sterile microfilter via a G400 gas mixing system (Qubit Systems Inc., Kingston, Ontario, Canada). The high dissolved O~2~ concentration of ~ 250 µM was achieved by sparging with lab air (78% N~2~, 21% O~2~, 1% Ar and 0.05% CO~2~). The low dissovled O~2~ concentration of ~ 2.5 µM, was achieved by sparging with a gas mixture containing 99.95% N~2~ and 0.05% CO~2~. O~2~ concentrations *in situ* were verified using oxygen optodes (PyroScience, Germany) inserted into tubes for real-time measurements (data not presented), wiht software correctiong to account for the salinity of the media (8 PSU).  The pH of tested cultures remained about 8, with limited fluctuation during the experiment (data not presented).

## Chlorophyll-specific growth rates {.unnumbered}

Picocyanobacterial growth was monitored every 5 minutes by automatically recording OD~680~, OD~720~, and ΔOD (ΔOD = OD~680~ – OD~720~) for at least 5 days, independently for each culture tube. The chlorophyll-specific growth rates (µ) were determined by fitting logistic growth curves using a modified Levenberg-Marquardt fitting algorithm [@elzhovMinpackLmInterface2023] to plots of the chlorophyll *a* proxy of ΔOD vs. elapsed time (d) for each combination of strain, spectral waveband, and O~2~ concentration. Growth curves, tracked as OD~680~, OD~720~, ΔOD and logistic fits of ΔOD vs. elapsed time are shown in Fig. S1 in Supplementary materials. Cell-specific  growth rates (µ) were also determined using OD~720~ (Fig. S2). 

<br>

## Picocyanobacteria cell counts {.unnumbered}

Picocyanobacterial cells mL^-1^ were estimated using linear regression models of OD at 680 nm or 720 nm vs. calibration counts of cell suspension densities (cell mL^−1^) (Table S1). The OD of cultures was measured using MCMIX-OD PSI Multicultivators (Photon Systems Instruments, Drásov, Czech Republic) and cell suspension density measures were conducted using an ImageXpress Pico Digital microscope equipped with CMOS camera and LED+ image autofocus (ImageXpress Pico Automated Cell Imaging System, Molecular Devices, LLC., CA, USA). Culture samples were preserved with 4% glutaraldehyde and kept at -80°C until the microscopy measures. Fixed samples of culture  (V = 10 µL) were transferred to Tissue Culture (TC)-treated surface, flat bottom black 96-well plates (Corning® Falcon® Microplate, MilliporeSigma, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) containing 200 µL of f/2 media and centrifuged using a Beckman J-20 centrifuge with a swinging bucket JS-4.3 rotor at 4500 rpm (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, United States). Cells were imaged with the Cy5 channels (Excitation: 630/40 nm; Emission: 695/45 nm; Dichroic: 655 nm) using selectable confocal geometries, which allowed us to distinguish cyanobacterial cells from co-occurring heterotrophic bacteria, and counted using a 63x objective in fluorescence imaging modes. Quantitative analysis on images acquired from automated microscopy obtained from 96-well microplates was performed using CellReporterXpress Image Acquisition and Analysis Software. The actual cell number mL^-1^ was calculated based on the dilution factor and selected count area from each well [@wlodkowicRecentProgressCytometric2022].

<br>

## Pigment content and pigment ratio {.unnumbered}

Whole-cell absorbance spectra of picocyanobacteria cells were collected using an integrating cavity spectrophotometer (CLARiTY 17 UV/Vis/NIR, On-Line Instrument Systems, Inc., Bogart, GA, USA) according to the method proposed by @blakeSituSpectroscopyIntact2012. The sample and reference observation cavities of the spectrophotometer were filled with 8 mL XXXXor 6 mL????XXX of f/2 medium at salinity 8 PSU. After establishing a baseline absorbance spectra from 375 to 710 nm, 4 mL culture medium was replaced with 4 mL of culture in the sample cavity. Pathlength corrected absorbance per cm was calculated using Jávorfi coefficients [@javorfiQuantitativeSpectrophotometryUsing2006]. We then conducted estimations of pigment content (µg mL^-1^) including Chlorophyll *a* (Chl *a*), Carotenoids (Car), Phycoerythrin (PE), Phycocyanin (PC), and Allophycocyanin (APC) from the PC-rich_077 and PE-rich_127 *Synechococcus* sp. cultures. These estimations were based on established linear correlations between pigment content, determined through extraction methods [@stricklandPracticalHandBook1972; @bennettComplementaryChromaticAdaptation1973], and absorbance values of individual pigment peaks (Car; 480 nm, PE; 565 nm, PC; 620 nm, APC; 650 nm, and Chl *a*; 665 nm) obtained from whole-cell absorbance spectra (Table S2). We also summed PE, PC, and APC protein to total Phycobiliprotein content. We then calculated the Car to Chl *a* ratio and the ratio of the sum of Phycobiliproteins to Chl *a* (µg:µg) for each strain (Fig. S3).

## PSII effective absorption cross section of PSII, turnover time of PSII photochemistry, and photochemical quenching coefficient {.unnumbered}

We harvested 4 mL of picocyanobacteria cultures for photophysiological characterizations repeatedly across the growth trajectories. For the low oxygen cultures, to ensure functional measurements were taken at low O~2~ of ~ 2.5 µM, we bubbled gently with N~2~ from a gas cylinder during measurements. O~2~ concentration was verified using oxygen optodes (PyroScience, Germany) inserted into culture samples for functional measurements (data not presented). 

We used Fast Repetition & Relaxation chlorophyll fluorescence (FRRf) [@kolberMeasurementsVariableChlorophyll1998] (Solisense, USA), with a lab built temperature control jacket (22℃), to apply a series of XX excitation flashlets of 1.2 µs to drive saturation, followed immediately by logarithmically spaced flashlets to track relaxation, fit using the onboard Solisense LIFT software [@falkowskiEstimationPhytoplanktonPhotosynthesis1993; @kolberMeasurementsVariableChlorophyll1998].

We used a double tap protocol [@xuConnectivityPhotosystemII2017], where FRRf induction/relaxation trajectories were collected during a rapid actinic light curve sequence increasing in steps of 10 s at 0, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ PAR. We applied 1 s darkness between the sequential 10 s steps of the light response curves, to allow re-opening of PSII.  Flashlets and actinic light were delivered from LED emitters centred at 445, preferentially exciting chlorophyll; 470, preferentially exciting phycourobilin (PUB); 530, preferentially exciting phycoerythrin (PE); or 590 nm, preferentially exciting phycocyanin (PC). Excitation flashlets and actinic light wavebands were matched for each run. These actinic and excitation wavebands in turn approximated 4 of our 7 growth light wavebands ( 450, 470, 530 & 620 nm), allowing us to evaluate *in situ* photosynthetic performance for those cultures.

Flashlet power delivered to the samples during the 1.2 µs flashlet duration was adjusted to achieve saturation of variable fluorescence; Ex~445nm~ at 60000 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ PAR; Ex~470nm~ and Ex~535nm~ at 25000 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ PAR; while for Ex~590nm~ excitation power at 14000 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^, calibrated using a quantum sensor (LI-250, LI-COR, Inc.) in the temperature controlled cuvette. 

We estimated effective absorption cross section of PSII (σ~PSII~; nm^2^ quanta^−1^); turnover time of PSII photochemistry (τ~PSII~; µs); and the photochemical quenching coefficient (q~P~)  XXXXCITATION using the FRRf induction curves, following [@xuConnectivityPhotosystemII2017].

## PSII electron flux {.unnumbered}

We calculated (Eq. \@ref(eq:JVPSII)) an uncalibrated fluorescence based estimator for volumetric electron transport, *JV*~PSII~, (k × e^−^ L^−1^ s^−1^) under Ex~445nm~, blue; Ex~470nm~, blue-green; Ex~535nm~, green; or Ex~590nm~, orange excitation bands [@oxboroughDirectEstimationFunctional2012; @boatmanImprovingAccuracySingle2019; @tortellUserGuideApplication2021].


\begin{equation}
  {JV_{PSII}} = \frac{σ_{PSII}′ × qP × I × F_O}{σ_{PSII} }
  (\#eq:JVPSII)
\end{equation}


where σ~PSII~′ is effective absorption cross section for PSII photochemistry under the relevant actinic PAR step (nm^2^ quanta^−1^); qP is an estimate of the fraction of PSII open for photochemistry estimated according to @oxboroughResolvingChlorophyllFluorescence1997; I is the applied PAR (µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^); *F*~O~ is the minimum fluorescence from a given sample and excitation waveband (relative fluorescence) and σ~PSII~ is the maximum effective absorption cross section for PSII photochemistry from a given sample and excitation waveband (nm^2^ quanta^−1^). 

We calibrated (Table S3)XXXXNOT a PROPER TABLE CITATIONXXX the *JV*~PSII~ estimator to absolute rates of electron transport (Eq. \@ref(eq:calibJVPSII)) using parallel measures of oxygen evolution (µmol O~2~ L^−1^ s^−1^), captured simultaneously with the FRRf measures, taken below light saturation of electron transport to limit distortion from electron fluxes back to oxygen under super-saturating light XXXhttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.8b03488XXXX, using a FireSting robust oxygen probe (PyroScience, Germany) inserted in the cuvette for select Rapid Light Curve (RLC) runs. 

\begin{equation}
  {JV_{PSII}(e^{−}~L^{−1}~s^{−1})} = \frac{Uncalibrated~JV_{PSII}(e^{−}~L^{−1}~s^{−1})}{Calibration~slope}
  (\#eq:calibJVPSII)
\end{equation}

XXXXMAYBE WE SHOULD ADD JVPSII to the LIGHT RESPONSE FUNCTIONAL FIGURE???XXXX

For the samples on whichFRRf measurements were performed, Chl *a* (µg mL^−1^) was also measured using Trilogy Laboratory Fluorometer (Turner Designs, Inc., CA, USA) equipped with Chlorophyll In-Vivo Module. Quantitative analysis of Chl *a* was obtained after adding 50 µL of picocyanobacteria culture and 2 mL of a 90% acetone:DMSO solution in a 3:2 ratio.

<br>

## Statistical analysis {.unnumbered}

We used R version 4.3.0 [@rcore] running under RStudio [@posit]. We performed three-way factorial ANOVA (*aov()* function; R Base package) to determine whether strain, growth waveband, O~2~ concentration, and their interactions, significantly influence the chlorophyll-specific growth rate (µ; d^−1^; Tab. S4) vs. pigment content (Tab. S5). We also performed three-way factorial ANOVA (*aov()* function) to determine whether strain, Actinic PAR, O~2~ concentration, and their interactions, significantly influence the responses of σ~PSII~ (Tab. S6); τ~PSII~ (Tab. S7); or q~P~ to increasing light (Tab. S8).

We used *t*-tests of linear fits to compare data across different strains and O~2~ concentrations for a given growth waveband, for chlorophyll-specific growth rate vs. Phycobiliproteins to Chl *a* ratio (Tab. S9). We also performed *t*-tests of linear fits to compare data across different strains and O~2~ concentration in situations in which cultures were excited by, and growing in, corresponding growth wavebands of 450, 470, 530, or 620 nm, for chlorophyll-specific growth rate vs. *JV*~PSII~ (Tab. S10). Statistical differences for all analyses were determined at significance level α = 0.05.

## Chlorophyll-specific growth rates {.unnumbered}

We used logistic curve fits (Fig. S1) to determine chlorophyll-specific growth rates (μ; d^−1^), for PC-rich and PE-rich cultures of *Synechococcus* sp. grown at spectral wavebands of 405, 450, 470, 530, 620, 660, or 730 nm and O~2~ concentrations of 250 µM or 2.5 µM (Fig. \@ref(fig:GrowthRate). 

Three-way factorial ANOVA showed that strain, growth waveband, O~2~ concentration, and their interactions, significantly affected μ (ANOVA, *p* < 0.05 for all; Table S4). 

In general, PE-rich strains achieved faster growth rates under O~2~ concentration of 2.5 µM than 250 µM whereas, PC-rich strain showed similar growth rates under 250 µM and 2.5 µM of O~2~ concentration across tested spectral waveband (nm). In the presence of high O~2~ concentrations (250 µM), PC-rich strain did not show growth at 405 nm and PE-rich strain did not growth at 405, 450, and 730 nm. On the other hand, in low O~2~ concentrations (2.5 µM), both PC-rich and PE-rich strain showed growth rates over the entire range of tested growth wavelength (405 – 730 nm). 

PC-rich *Synechococcus* sp. showed distinct growth peak at red light where μ = 0.165 ± 0.030 d^−1^ at 620 nm and μ = 0.164 ± 0.032 d^−1^ at 660 nm under O~2~ concentration of 250 µM and μ = 0.137 ± 0.026 d^−1^ at 620 nm and μ = 0.141 ± 0.028 d^−1^ at 660 nm) under O~2~ concentration of 2.5 µM.

PE-rich strain showed the highest growth rate under green light at 530 nm under 250 µM of O~2~ (μ = 0.131 ± 0.046 d^−1^). However, under O~2~ concentration of 2.5 µM, high growth rates were recorded for 530 nm (μ = 0.181 ± 0.021 d^−1^), 620 nm (μ = 0.184 ± 0.019 d^−1^) and 660 nm (μ = 0.180 ± 0.019 d^−1^).
