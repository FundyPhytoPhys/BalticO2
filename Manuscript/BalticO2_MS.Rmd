# Abstract {.unnumbered}

*Synechococcus*, one of the most abundant primary producers in marine ecosystems, exhibit surprising thrive in low oxygen environments, such as Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs) and the wide range of spectral wavebands, prevalent at depths in the world’s ocean. We found that PhycoCyanin(PC)-rich and PhycoErythrin(PE)-rich *Synechococcus* sp. are able to grow under 2.5 µM oxygen concentration [O~2~], across the range of tested spectral wavebands from 405 – 730 nm. The PC-rich strain showed generally similar chlorophyll-specific growth rates (µ; d^−1^) under tested conditions, whereas PE-rich cultures achieved faster growth rates under 2.5 µM [O~2~] than under 250 µM [O~2~]. As expected, PC-rich strain showed a peak in growth rate under red light (620 or 660 nm). However, under 2.5 µM [O~2~] the PE-rich strain showed similar and high growth rates under 530 nm – 660 nm. Here, we also showed that the pigment content varies depending on the [O~2~] and growth wavebands. PC-rich *Synechococcus* sp. had higher phycobiliproteins content under 250 µM [O~2~], while for PE-rich strain, the highest phycobiliproteins content was noted under 620 nm and 2.5 µM [O~2~]. For PC-rich and PE-rich *Synechococcus* sp., µ showed also positive linear responses to both Phycobiliproteins:Chlorophyll *a* ratio, and cumulative diel PSII electron flux (*JV*~PSII~), although the relations vary across strain and [O~2~]. Under orange excitation at Ex~590nm~, σ~PSII~ was higher at 250 µM [O~2~] compared to 2.5 µM [O~2~] for the PC-rich strain, on the contrary, what was shown by PE-rich culture. τ~PSII~, was generally faster and q~P~ was generally higher for both PC-rich and PE-rich strains under 250 µM [O~2~], since cyanobacteria show strong capacity for electron flow away from PSII to O~2~, particularly under excess excitation. PE-rich *Synechococcus* sp. are typically found at greater depths, and lower light, than are PC-rich strains but we suggest that the PE-rich strains are actually limited to lower light by an interaction between light and full air-saturated [O~2~]. In lower oxygen waters PE-rich strains are likely able to exploit higher light niches.

# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Oxygen regulates the global cycling of nutrients and carbon. Since the mid-20^th^ century, declining oxygen concentrations in regions of the open ocean and coastal waters [@breitburgDecliningOxygenGlobal2018] have emerged, affecting productivity, biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles in marine ecosystems [@keelingOceanDeoxygenationWarming2010]. Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) in open oceans have expanded to an area equivalent to the European Union, and the global volume of oxygen-free water has quadrupled [@breitburgDecliningOxygenGlobal2018]. It is thus necessary to understand which species will survive and dominate under the influence of ongoing and predicted changes in ocean oxygen concentrations.

Picocyanobacteria numerically dominate the phytoplankton across vast tracts of the world’s oceans, notably in oligotrophic regions, but also in some coastal ecosystems CITATIONS. Low oxygen environments in the ocean, termed Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZ) [@wongPhytoplanktonRequireOxygen2023] are characterized by low dissolved oxygen concentrations, posing challenges for aerobic organisms. However, picocyanobacteria species have evolved diverse strategies to cope with these conditions. Picocyanobacteria, can perform photosynthesis under extremely low light and oxygen levels, utilizing specialized pigments and photosystems to capture and utilize light energy efficiently [@luimstraBlueLightReduces2018; @murphyPhotoinactivationPhotosystemII2017]  XXXMURPHY DID NOT TEST LOW O2?XXXX. Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted genetic adaptations in cyanobacteria populations inhabiting OMZs, enabling them to tolerate and even thrive in oxygen-depleted environments. These adaptations encompass genetic modifications related to energy metabolism, antioxidant defense mechanisms, and cellular structures optimized for oxygen scavenging and storage [@ulloaMicrobialOceanographyAnoxic2012] XXXXTHERE ARE MORE RECENT REFERENCESXXXX. Overall, the occurrence and adaptation of picocyanobacteria to low oxygen environments are critical components of marine ecosystems, shaping their productivity and biodiversity in OMZ regions.

Another important factor that should be considered when predicting the occurrence of dominant picocyanobacteria in the water column during changing environmental conditions is their adaptation to various spectral wavebands, ranging from short-wavelength blue light, through green and yellow light to long-wavelength red light. Despite competition theory often overlooking the light spectrum as a significant axis of niche differentiation, plankton ecologists have long acknowledged that the diverse array of photosynthetic pigments allows cyanobacteria species to exploit different spectral wavebands [@falkowskiEvolutionModernEukaryotic2004; @stompColourfulCoexistenceRed2007a]. The genus *Synechococcus* is genetically highly diverse and phylogenetically divided into several major clusters. Picocyanobacteria from *Synechococcus* cluster 5 are often found in marine, brackish and freshwater environments [@aguileraEcophysiologicalAnalysisReveals2023]. *Synechococcus* cluster 5 include sub-clusters of strains rich in phycoerythrin (PE-rich), which imparts a range of orange, reddish, pink, and purple colors, as well as sub-clusters of strains rich in phycocyanin (PC-rich), which color the organism in various shades of blue-green. Competition experiments have demonstrated that PE-rich and PC-rich strains can coexist in white light, but show spectral niche differentiation [@stompAdaptiveDivergencePigment2004a]  XXXXFIND ORIGINAL CITATION; this was natural communities I thinkXXXX which elucidates the distribution patterns of reddish PE-rich vs.  and blue-green PC-rich strains in natural waters. PE-rich strains dominate in deeper waters where blue light predominates, due to their relatively high content of the chromophore phycourobilin (PUB), while communities shift towards *Synechococcus* with more phycoerythrobilin (PEB) in more mesotrophic marine waters characterized by blue-green light environments. Conversely, PC-rich strains prevail in turbid waters where orange and red light dominate. The widespread coexistence of PE-rich and PC-rich picocyanobacteria is observed in waters of intermediate turbidity, such as mesotrophic lakes and coastal seas [@haverkampColorfulMicrodiversitySynechococcus2009a].

The ecological success of picoplanktonic *Synechococcus* sp. throughout the photic oceanic water column [@flombaumPresentFutureGlobal2013] shows diverse strategies to respond to variations in their environment [@scanlanMarinePicocyanobacteria2012]. Thus, the aim of this work was to demonstrate the ecophysiological response of PC-rich and PE-rich *Synechococcus* sp. cultures to different oxygen concentrations (250 µM or 2.5 µM [O~2~]) and spectral wavebands from 405 – 730 nm. In this work, we empirically answer the question posed by @wongPhytoplanktonRequireOxygen2023 regarding the sensitivity of modern picocyanobacteria to low levels of O~2~ and the wide range of the light spectrum found at greater depths, and which species will dominate in these waters in the near future.

# Materials and methods {.unnumbered}

## Culture condition and experimental setup {.unnumbered}

Xenic cultures of  PC-rich (CCBA_077) and PE-rich (CCBA_127) *Synechococcus* sp. were obtained from the Culture Collection of Baltic Algae (https://ccba.ug.edu.pl/pages/en/home.php) [@latalaCultureCollectionBaltic2006]. *Synechococcus* sp. strains were cultured in Tissue Culture Flasks (VWR International, Cat. No. 10062-872, PA, USA) and transferred biweekly to fresh f/2 media [@guillardCulturePhytoplanktonFeeding1975] prepared at a salinity of 8 PSU, reflective of their natural brackish habitat. Pre-cultures were maintained in incubators with full air saturated dissolved oxygen concentration [O~2~] of 250 µM, 22℃, with a light/dark cycle of 12 h and Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) of 10 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ from Philips Cool White F14T5/841 Alto, 14 watts, fluorescent bulbs.

Controlled growth experiments were performed using MCMIX-OD PSI Multicultivators (Photon Systems Instruments, Drásov, Czech Republic) set to 22℃. Each of 8 round bottom cylindrical glass tubes contained 75 mL of f/2 medium and 5 mL of growing pre-culture. These parameters allowed for exponential growth of the cultures from the beginning of the experiment, with little lag phase. Inoculation of culture tubes took place in the afternoon, with a period of low light and then 12 h darkness before a sinusoidal 12 h photoperiod cycle commenced at 07:00 the following morning, with peak PAR of 180 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ reached at 13:00 each day.

Each tube was maintained under an individual combination of one of 7 spectral wavebands (centred at 405, 450, 470, 530, 620, 660, or 730 nm); at 250 µM or 2.5 µM [O~2~]. Culture tubes were closed with a silicone inert silicone stopper perforated by an aeration input tube extending to the bottom of the culture tube, and a pressure outlet tube. We used aeration with a total gas flow rate of around ~ 140 mL min^−1^ tube^−1^ through a 0.2µm sterile microfilter provided via a G400 gas mixing system (Qubit Systems Inc., Kingston, Ontario, Canada). ~ 250 µM [O~2~] was achieved by sparging with lab air (78% N~2~, 21% O~2~, 1% Ar and 0.05% CO~2~). ~ 2.5 µM [O~2~] was achieved by sparging with a gas mixture containing 99.95% N~2~ and 0.05% CO~2~. [O~2~] *in situ* was verified using oxygen optodes (PyroScience, Germany) inserted into tubes for real-time measurements (data not presented), with software correction to account for the salinity of the media (8 PSU). The pH of tested cultures remained about 8, with limited fluctuation during the growth experiment (data not presented). 

<br>

## Chlorophyll-specific growth rates {.unnumbered}

Picocyanobacterial growth was monitored every 5 minutes by automatically recording OD~680~, OD~720~, and ΔOD (ΔOD = OD~680~ – OD~720~) for at least 5 days, independently for each culture tube. The chlorophyll-specific growth rates (µ) were determined by fitting logistic growth curves using a modified Levenberg-Marquardt fitting algorithm [@elzhovMinpackLmInterface2023] to plots of the chlorophyll *a* proxy of ΔOD vs. elapsed time (d) for each combination of strain, spectral waveband, and [O~2~]. Growth curves, tracked as OD~680~, OD~720~, ΔOD and logistic fits of ΔOD vs. elapsed time are shown in Fig. S1 in Supplementary materials. Cell-specific growth rates (µ) were also determined using OD~720~ (Fig. S2). 

<br>

## Picocyanobacteria cell counts {.unnumbered}

Picocyanobacterial cells mL^−1^ were estimated using linear regression models of OD at 680 nm or 720 nm vs. calibration counts of cell suspension densities (cell mL^−1^) (Table S1). The OD of cultures was measured using MCMIX-OD PSI Multicultivators (Photon Systems Instruments, Drásov, Czech Republic) and cell suspension density measures were conducted using an ImageXpress Pico Digital microscope equipped with CMOS camera and LED+ image autofocus (ImageXpress Pico Automated Cell Imaging System, Molecular Devices, LLC., CA, USA). Culture samples were preserved with 4% glutaraldehyde and kept at -80°C until the microscopy measures. Fixed samples of culture  (V = 10 µL) were transferred to Tissue Culture (TC)-treated surface, flat bottom black 96-well plates (Corning® Falcon® Microplate, MilliporeSigma, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) containing 200 µL of f/2 media and centrifuged using a Beckman J-20 centrifuge with a swinging bucket JS-4.3 rotor at 4500 rpm (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, United States). Cells were imaged with the Cy5 channels (Excitation: 630/40 nm; Emission: 695/45 nm; Dichroic: 655 nm) using selectable confocal geometries, which allowed us to distinguish cyanobacterial cells from co-occurring heterotrophic bacteria, and counted using a 63x objective in fluorescence imaging modes. Quantitative analysis on images acquired from automated microscopy obtained from 96-well microplates was performed using CellReporterXpress Image Acquisition and Analysis Software. The actual cell number mL^−1^ was calculated based on the dilution factor and selected count area from each well [@wlodkowicRecentProgressCytometric2022].

<br>

## Pigment content and pigment ratio {.unnumbered}

Whole-cell absorbance spectra of picocyanobacteria cells were collected using an integrating cavity spectrophotometer (CLARiTY 17 UV/Vis/NIR, On-Line Instrument Systems, Inc., Bogart, GA, USA) according to the method proposed by @blakeSituSpectroscopyIntact2012. The sample and reference observation cavities of the spectrophotometer were filled with 8 mL of f/2 medium at salinity 8 PSU. After establishing a baseline absorbance spectra from 375 to 710 nm, 4 mL culture medium was replaced with 4 mL of culture in the sample cavity. Pathlength corrected absorbance per cm was calculated using Jávorfi coefficients [@javorfiQuantitativeSpectrophotometryUsing2006]. We then conducted estimations of pigment content (µg mL^−1^) including Chlorophyll *a* (Chl *a*), Carotenoids (Car), Phycoerythrin (PE), Phycocyanin (PC), and Allophycocyanin (APC) from the PC-rich and PE-rich *Synechococcus* sp. cultures. These estimations were based on established linear correlations between pigment content, determined through extraction methods [@stricklandPracticalHandBook1972; @bennettComplementaryChromaticAdaptation1973], and absorbance values of individual pigment peaks (Car; 480 nm, PE; 565 nm, PC; 620 nm, APC; 650 nm, and Chl *a*; 665 nm) obtained from whole-cell absorbance spectra (Table S2). We also summed PE, PC, and APC protein to total Phycobiliproteins content. We then calculated the Car to Chl *a* ratio, and the ratio of the sum of Phycobiliproteins to Chl *a* (µg:µg) for each strain (Fig. S3).

## PSII effective absorption cross section of PSII, turnover time of PSII photochemistry, and photochemical quenching coefficient {.unnumbered}

We harvested 4 mL of picocyanobacteria cultures repeatedly across the growth trajectories for photophysiological characterizations. For the low oxygen cultures, to ensure photophysiological measurements were taken at low O~2~ of ~ 2.5 µM, we bubbled gently with N~2~ from a gas cylinder during measurements. [O~2~] was verified in culture samples for photophysiological measurements using oxygen optodes (PyroScience, Germany) inserted (data not presented). 

We used Fast Repetition & Relaxation chlorophyll fluorescence (FRRf) [@kolberMeasurementsVariableChlorophyll1998] (Solisense, USA), with a lab built temperature control jacket (22℃), to apply a series of 100 excitation flashlets of 1.6 µs to drive saturation of PSII variable fluorescence, followed immediately by logarithmically spaced flashlets to track relaxation of variable fluorescence. Induction/relaxation trajectories were fit using the onboard Solisense LIFT software [@falkowskiEstimationPhytoplanktonPhotosynthesis1993; @kolberMeasurementsVariableChlorophyll1998].

We used a double tap protocol [@xuConnectivityPhotosystemII2017], where FRRf induction/relaxation trajectories were collected during a rapid actinic light curve sequence increasing in steps of 10 s at 0, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ PAR. We applied 1 s darkness between the sequential 10 s steps of the light response curves, to allow re-opening of PSII immediately after application of the sequential increasing light steps. Flashlets and actinic light were delivered from LED emitters centred at Ex~445nm~, preferentially exciting chlorophyll; Ex~470nm~,, preferentially exciting phycourobilin (PUB); Ex~535nm~, preferentially exciting phycoerythrin (PE); or Ex~590nm~, preferentially exciting phycocyanin (PC). Excitation flashlets and actinic light wavebands were matched for each run. These actinic and excitation wavebands in turn approximated 4 of our 7 growth light wavebands (450, 470, 530 & 620 nm), allowing us to evaluate *in situ* photosynthetic performance for those culture conditions.

Flashlet power delivered to the samples during the 1.6 µs flashlet duration was adjusted to achieve saturation of variable fluorescence; Ex~445nm~ at 60000 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ PAR; Ex~470nm~ at 30000 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ PAR; Ex~535nm~ at 25000 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ PAR; while for Ex~590nm~ excitation power at 14000 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^, calibrated using a quantum sensor (LI-250, LI-COR, Inc.) in the temperature controlled cuvette. 

We estimated effective absorption cross section of PSII (σ~PSII~; nm^2^ quanta^−1^); turnover time of PSII photochemistry (τ~PSII~; µs); and the photochemical quenching coefficient (q~P~) using the FRRf induction curves, following [@xuConnectivityPhotosystemII2017].  We fit a model with three τ~PSII~ to describe the re-opening of PSII after closure by the saturating flash train.  For subsequent analyses we estimated an average of the three τ~PSII~, weighted by their respective amplitudes, to describe the overall time to reopen PSII after closure.

\u03C3~PSII~ (Fig. S4); \u03C4~PSII~ (Fig. S5); or q~P~ (Fig. S6) vs. Actinic PAR (µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^) under excitation at Ex~445nm~, blue; Ex~470nm~, blue-green; Ex~535nm~, green; or Ex~590nm~, orange; for PC-rich or PE-rich cultures of *Synechococcus* sp. grown at spectral bandwidths of 450, 470, 530, or 620 nm and O~2~ concentrations of 250 µM or 2.5 µM are shown in Supplementary materials.

## PSII electron flux {.unnumbered}

We calculated (Eq. \@ref(eq:JVPSII)) an uncalibrated fluorescence based estimator for volumetric electron transport, *JV*~PSII~, (k × e^−^ L^−1^ s^−1^) under Ex~445nm~, blue; Ex~470nm~, blue-green; Ex~535nm~, green; or Ex~590nm~, red-orange excitation bands [@oxboroughDirectEstimationFunctional2012; @boatmanImprovingAccuracySingle2019; @tortellUserGuideApplication2021].


\begin{equation}
  {JV_{PSII}} = \frac{σ_{PSII}′ × q_{P} × I × F_O}{σ_{PSII} }
  (\#eq:JVPSII)
\end{equation}


where σ~PSII~′ is effective absorption cross section for PSII photochemistry under the relevant actinic PAR step (nm^2^ quanta^−1^); q~P~ is an estimate of the fraction of PSII open for photochemistry estimated according to @oxboroughResolvingChlorophyllFluorescence1997; I is the applied PAR (µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^); *F*~O~ is the minimum fluorescence from a given sample and excitation waveband (relative fluorescence) and σ~PSII~ is the maximum effective absorption cross section for PSII photochemistry from a given sample and excitation waveband (nm^2^ quanta^−1^). 

We calibrated the *JV*~PSII~ estimator to absolute rates of electron transport (Eq. \@ref(eq:calibJVPSII)) using parallel measures of oxygen evolution (µmol O~2~ L^−1^ s^−1^), captured simultaneously with the FRRf measures, taken below light saturation of electron transport to limit distortion from electron fluxes back to oxygen under super-saturating light [@hughesRoadmapsDetoursActive2018], using a FireSting robust oxygen probe (PyroScience, Germany) inserted in the cuvette for select Rapid Light Curve (RLC) runs (Table S3). 

\begin{equation}
  {JV_{PSII}(e^{−}~L^{−1}~s^{−1})} = \frac{Uncalibrated~JV_{PSII}(e^{−}~L^{−1}~s^{−1})}{Calibration~slope}
  (\#eq:calibJVPSII)
\end{equation}

PSII electron flux (*JV*~PSII~; µmol e^−^ L^−1^ s^−1^) vs. Actinic PAR (µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^) estimated using FRRf induction curves with excitation at Ex~445nm~, blue; Ex~470nm~, blue-green; Ex~535nm~, green; or Ex~590nm~, orange; for PC-rich or PE-rich cultures of *Synechococcus* sp. grown at spectral bandwidths of 450, 470, 530, or 620 nm and O~2~ concentrations of 250 µM or 2.5 µM are also presented (Fig. S7).

Next, we converted *JV*~PSII~ (µmol e^−^ L^−1^ s^−1^) to *JV*~PSII~ (µmol e^−^ µmol Chl *a*^−1^ d^−1^) by performing Chl *a* (µg L^−1^) measurements using Trilogy Laboratory Fluorometer (Turner Designs, Inc., CA, USA) equipped with Chlorophyll In-Vivo Module, on the samples taken for the FRRf measurements.

## Statistical analysis {.unnumbered}

We used R version 4.3.0 [@rcore] running under RStudio [@posit]. We performed three-way factorial ANOVA (*aov()* function; R Base package) to determine whether strain, growth waveband, and [O~2~] significantly influence the chlorophyll-specific growth rate (µ; d^−1^; Tab. S4) vs. pigment content (Tab. S5). We also performed three-way factorial ANOVA (*aov()* function) to determine whether strain, Actinic PAR, and [O~2~] significantly influence the responses of σ~PSII~ (Tab. S6); τ~PSII~ (Tab. S7); q~P~ (Tab. S8); or *JV*~PSII~ (Tab. S9) to increasing light.

XXXMention Harris & Platt Curve Fitting using, I think nlsLM???XXXX

We used *t*-tests of linear regressions to compare data across different strains and [O~2~] for a given growth waveband, for chlorophyll-specific growth rate vs. Phycobiliproteins to Chl *a* ratio (Tab. S10). We also performed *t*-tests of linear fits to compare data across different strains and [O~2~] in situations in which cultures were excited by, and growing in, corresponding growth wavebands of 450, 470, 530, or 620 nm, for chlorophyll-specific growth rate vs. *JV*~PSII~ (Tab. S11). Statistical differences for all analyses were determined at significance level α = 0.05.

## Chlorophyll-specific growth rates across [O~2~], spectral wavebands, and strains {.unnumbered}

We used logistic curve fits (Fig. S1) to determine chlorophyll-specific growth rates (μ; d^−1^) for PC-rich and PE-rich cultures of *Synechococcus* sp. grown under spectral wavebands centred at 405, 450, 470, 530, 620, 660, or 730 nm, and [O~2~]  of 250 µM or 2.5 µM (Fig. \@ref(fig:GrowthRate)). Cell-specific growth rates (µ; d^−1^) were also determined using OD~720~ (Fig. S2). Strain, growth waveband, [O~2~], and their interactions, significantly affected μ (Table S4). 
PC-rich and PE-rich *Synechococcus* sp. grow under 2.5 µM [O~2~], across the range of tested spectral wavebands from 405 – 730 nm. In contrast, under 250 µM [O~2~], the PC-rich strain failed to grow under 405 nm, while the PE-rich strain failed to grow under 405, 450, and 730 nm. The PC-rich strain showed generally similar growth rates under 2.5 and 250 µM [O~2~], across tested spectral wavebands (nm). In contrast the PE-rich strain achieved faster growth rates under 2.5 µM [O~2~] than under 250 µM [O~2~]. 

PC-rich *Synechococcus* sp. showed a peak in growth rate under red light of 620 or 660 nm, absorbed by phycocyanin and chlorophyll. Under 2.5 µM [O~2~] the PE-rich strain showed high growth rates under 530 nm – 660 nm absorbed by phycoerythin, phycocyanin, and chlorophyll; while under 250 µM [O~2~], the PE-rich strain showed the highest growth rate under green light of 530 nm absorbed by phycoerythrin.

## Pigment content and pigment ratio across [O~2~], spectral wavebands, and strains {.unnumbered}

Fig. \@ref(fig:Pigment)*a* presents Chlorophyll *a* (Chl *a*), Phycobiliproteins (Phyco), or Carotenoids (Car) content (pg cell ^−1^) vs. growth waveband (nm) for PC-rich and PE-rich cultures of *Synechococcus* sp. grown at spectral wavebands centred at 405, 450, 470, 530, 620, 660, or 730 nm and 250 or 2.5 µM [O~2~]. To focus on the responses of growing cells, we omit pigmentation data from those PE-rich cultures which showed negligible growth under 405, 450, 730 nm and 250 µM [O~2~]; and from those PC-rich cultures which showed negligible growth under 405 nm and 250 µM [O~2~]. 

Strain, growth waveband, [O~2~], and their interactions, significantly affected cell-specific Chl *a*, Phycobiliproteins, and Car content (Table S5). For the PC-rich strain, the highest Chl *a*, Phycobiliproteins, and Car contents were recorded after growth under 730 nm. Moreover, the phycobiliproteins content was higher under 250 µM [O~2~] than under 2.5 µM [O~2~] for the PC-rich strain. In contrast for PE-rich *Synechococcus* sp. phycobiliproteins content was significantly lower under 250 µM [O~2~] than under 2.5 µM [O~2~], with the highest phycobiliproteins content under 620 nm and 2.5 µM [O~2~].

Chlorophyll-specific growth rates (µ; d^−1^) show positive linear responses to the Phycobiliproteins:Chlorophyll *a* ratio (µg:µg), for both PC-rich and PE-rich *Synechococcus* sp. (Fig. \@ref(fig:Pigment)*b*), although the relations vary across strain and [O~2~] (Tab. S10).

## Effective absorption cross sections, turnover times, and photochemical quenching of PSII across [O~2~], spectral wavebands, and strains {.unnumbered}

Light response curves of effective absorption cross section of PSII (σ~PSII~; nm^2^ quanta^−1^); turnover time of PSII photochemistry (τ~PSII~; µs); and photochemical quenching coefficient (q~P~) vs. Actinic PAR (µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^) (Fig. \@ref(fig:SigLRC)*a-c*) are shown for PC-rich and PE-rich cultures grown in, and excited by, corresponding wavebands of 450, 470, 530, or 620 nm, at 250 µM or 2.5 µM [O~2~]. We omit functional data determined for those PE-rich cultures which showed negligible growth under 405, 450, 730 nm and 250 µM O~2~; and for those PC-rich cultures which showed negligible growth under 405 nm and 250 µM O~2~. In the Supplementary materials (Fig S4-S6), we also show the light response curves for all available excitation (Ex~445nm~, blue; Ex~470nm~, blue-green; Ex~535nm~, green; or Ex~590nm~, orange) and growth waveband (450, 470, 530, or 620 nm) cross-combinations.

σ~PSII~ (Fig. \@ref(fig:SigLRC)*a*), as expected, was low and shows little change with increasing actinic light during excitation through chlorophyll at Ex~445nm~. For the PC-rich strain, under orange excitation at Ex~590nm~, σ~PSII~ showed an initial small increase from darkness to the growth light level, followed by a mild decrease with increasing Actinic PAR, and was higher at 250 µM [O~2~] compared to 2.5 µM [O~2~]. For the PE-rich strain, we again see a small increase from darkness to the growth light level, followed by a decrease in σ~PSII~ with increasing Actinic PAR. Moreover, for the PE-rich strain σ~PSII~ was higher in low [O~2~] conditions than in high [O~2~] conditions. Strain, Actinic PAR, and [O~2~] significantly influenced σ~PSII~ under excitation at Ex~590nm~ (Table S6).

For the PC-rich strain, across the excitation wavebands tested, τ~PSII~ showed an acceleration (decrease) from darkness to growth light Actinic PAR (Fig. \@ref(fig:SigLRC)*b*), to a plateau of ~ 800 µs. PE-rich strains, on the other hand, showed a progressive acceleration (decrease) with increasing Actinic PAR under excitation at Ex~470nm~, Ex~535nm~, or Ex~590nm~, declining towards ~ 400 µs under Ex~590nm~. Thus, the PE-rich strain showed more capacity to remove electrons from PSII.  τ~PSII~, was generally faster (smaller) for both PC-rich and PE-rich strains under 250 µM [O~2~]. Strain, Actinic PAR, and [O~2~] significantly affected τ~PSII~ at Ex~470nm~, Ex~535nm~ and Ex~590nm~ (Table S7).

q~P~, across the excitation wavebands tested, showed a strong decrease with increasing Actinic PAR (Fig. \@ref(fig:SigLRC)*c*). q~P~ was generally higher for both PC-rich and PE-rich strains under 250 µM [O~2~]. Strain, Actinic PAR, and [O~2~] significantly affected q~P~ at Ex~470nm~, Ex~535nm~, and Ex~590nm~ (Table S8).

## PSII electron flux across [O~2~], spectral wavebands, and strains {.unnumbered}


PSII electron flux (*JV*~PSII~) measures the total generation of reductant available to support biosynthetic assimilation and growth. Light response curves of PSII electron flux (*JV*~PSII~; µmol e^−^ µmol Chl *a*^−1^ s^−1^) vs. Actinic PAR (µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^) are shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:JVPSII)*a*. *JV*~PSII~ was estimated using FRRf induction curves with excitation at Ex~445nm~, Ex~470nm~, Ex~535nm~, or Ex~590nm~, corresponding to growth wavebands of 450, 470, 530, or 620 nm and 250 µM or 2.5 µM [O~2~]. We do not present *JV*~PSII~ data for those PE-rich cultures which showed negligible growth under 405, 450, 730 nm and 250 µM O~2~; nor for those PC-rich cultures which showed negligible growth under 405 nm and 250 µM O~2~. 

For the PC-rich strain, under all tested excitations (Ex~445nm~, Ex~470nm~, Ex~535nm~, or Ex~590nm~), *JV*~PSII~  an increased with increasing actinic PAR, and did not fully saturate across the range of tested actinic PAR. Under all excitations except Ex~590nm~ we noted that *JV*~PSII~ was higher at 2.5 µM [O~2~] compared to 250 µM [O~2~]. On the other hand, for the PE-rich strain,  *JV*~PSII~ under Ex~470nm~, Ex~535nm~, or Ex~590nm~ was higher at 250 µM [O~2~] compared to 2.5 µM [O~2~]. Moreover, for the PE-rich strain *JV*~PSII~ plateaued above ~90 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^ under Ex~535nm~, or Ex~590nm~ for both low and high [O~2~]. *JV*~PSII~ for cultures grown under,  and excited through, Ex~445nm~ absorbed by chlorophyll, shows no difference between low and high [O~2~] with increasing actinic light. Strain, Actinic PAR, and [O~2~] did significantly influence *JV*~PSII~ under some of the tested excitations (Table S9).

Fig. \@ref(fig:JVPSII)*b* presents linear regressions between chlorophyll-specific growth rates (µ; d^−1^) and cumulative diel PSII electron flux (*JV*~PSII~; µmol e^−^ µmol Chl *a*^−1^ d^−1^) measured under half (90 µmol photons m^−2^s^−1^) of the diel peak PAR growth light. 

µ (d^−1^), as expected, is positively correlated with *JV*~PSII~, with slopes significantly greater than 0. [O~2~] significantly influences the linear regressions between chlorophyll-specific growth rates and PSII electron flux for both PC-rich and PE-rich strains of *Synechococcus* sp. (*p* < 0.05, Tab. S11). In the PC-rich strain higher [O~2~] increases the growth yield of electron transport.  In contrast, in the PE-rich strain, higher [O~2~] decreases the growth yield of electron transport.  On the other hand, the regressions for a given [O~2~] are not significantly different between the two strains (*p* > 0.05, Tab. S11).

# Discussion {.unnumbered}

## Growth rate of PC-rich and PE-rich picocyanobacteria across [O~2~] and spectral wavebands {.unnumbered}

Picocyanobacteria are major contributors to primary marine production. Picocyanobacteria from the genus *Synechococcus* tolerate a wide range of environmental factors [@aguileraEcophysiologicalAnalysisReveals2023; @sliwinska-wilczewskaEcophysiologicalCharacteristicsRed2018] but the interactive influence of  of [O~2~] and spectral wavebands on their growth rate and ecophysiology has not yet been investigated.

PC-rich and PE-rich *Synechococcus* sp. from coastal habitats are therefore exposed to rapid changes in both irradiance and spectral waveband through vertical movements inthe mixed layer. Fluctuation in light color may result in photoinactivation of photosystem II beyond counteracting repair rates through protein turnover, thereby leading to photoinhibition and cessation of growth rate [@sixLightVariabilityIlluminates2007]. Indeed, we showed that under 250 µM [O~2~], the PC-rich strain failed to grow under 405 nm, while the PE-rich strain failed to grow under 405, 450, and 730 nm. Failure of growth under 405 & 450 nm is consistent with accelerated photoinactivation of PSII under blue wavebands [@murphyPhotoinactivationPhotosystemII2017], which increases the cost of growth. In this work we also found that µ showed positive linear responses to both Phycobiliproteins:Chlorophyll *a* ratio, and cumulative diel PSII electron flux (*JV*~PSII~) for *Synechococcus* sp., although the relations vary across strain and [O~2~]. The chlorophyll *a* content did not change as dramatically as phycobiliproteins therefore, this means that mostly  phycobiliproteins content and the number of electrons flux through the PSII directly affect the growth rate, even when the [O~2~] is low.

As noted by @wongPhytoplanktonRequireOxygen2023, vertical structures of phytoplankton communities in the OMZ are not sufficiently explained by top-down predation pressure or factors such as light and/or nutrient limitation and thus, phytoplankton may actually have a higher than expected direct O~2~ requirement and can be inhibited by low O~2~ levels. However, in our work we have shown that low oxygen levels do not affect, and sometimes even have a beneficial effect on different *Synechococcus* sp. phenotypes. What is more, historical data link major extinction events to warm climates and oxygen-deficient oceans, suggesting that current anthropogenic activities could lead to widespread oxygen deficiency in the oceans within a thousand years [@breitburgDecliningOxygenGlobal2018]. The PC-rich strain showed generally similar growth rates under tested [O~2~], while PE-rich strain achieved faster growth rates under low (2.5 µM) than under high (250 µM) [O~2~]. PE-rich *Synechococcus* are typically found at greater depths, and lower light, than are PC-rich strains [@haverkampColorfulMicrodiversitySynechococcus2009a; @sliwinska-wilczewskaEcophysiologicalCharacteristicsRed2018] but we suggest that the PE-rich strains are actually limited to lower light by an interaction between light and full air-saturated [O~2~]. In lower oxygen waters PE-rich strains are likely able to exploit higher light niches.

## Physiological adaptations of PC-rich and PE-rich picocyanobacteria to [O~2~] and spectral wavebands {.unnumbered}

The phenotypes of *Synechococcus* also vary in pigment composition, enabling them to exploit different spectral niches [@mooreComparativePhysiologySynechococcus1995]. With a small diameter of 0.8–2.0 µm, *Synechococcus* sp. possess a high surface-to-volume ratio [@sliwinska-wilczewskaAllelopathicBloomformingPicocyanobacteria2018]. This small size minimizes the pigment package effect [@finkelLightAbsorptionSize2001], resulting in high optical absorption efficiency per pigment. This characteristic allows them to thrive deep in the water column [@mooreComparativePhysiologySynechococcus1995]. Although this adaptation is optimal for photon capture, it also increases their susceptibility to light-induced damage [@llabresEffectsUltravioletRadiation2010; @llabresPicophytoplanktonCellDeath2006]. Consequently, *Synechococcus* sp. serves as an intriguing model species for studying photosynthesis and photoacclimation across different oxygen levels and spectral wavebands due to its ecological significance.

*Synechococcus* sp. utilize various pigment-proteins to harvest light energy and protect Photosystem II (PSII) from photodamage. They possess an extra-membrane antenna complex called the phycobilisome, which consists of phycocyanin rods radiating from allophycocyanin core proteins. Core-membrane linker proteins attach the phycobilisome to the thylakoid membrane, transferring harvested light energy to chlorophyll *a* and carotenoids within the PSII complex [@scanlanMarinePicocyanobacteria2012]. In some *Synechococcus* sp., a carotenoids can regulate the connectivity of the phycobilisome to the reaction center, mediating non-photochemical quenching of excitation [@wilsonSolubleCarotenoidProtein2006, @gorbunovKineticModelNonphotochemical2011, @kirilovskyModulatingEnergyArriving2015]. In our work we noted that both carotenoid content (Fig. \@ref(fig:Pigment)) and the Car to Chl *a* ratio (Fig. Sxxx) did not change under the different [O~2~]. What is more, for the PE-rich strain, the carotenoids content did not change across tested wavebands. On the other hand, for PC-rich picocyanobacteria, a slight increase in this pigment was recorded at 405 nm and 730 nm. This could indicate that PC-rich *Synechococcus* sp. use carotenoids better to regulate the connectivity of the phycobilisome to the reaction center across different wavebands than PE-rich strain. However, the oxygen levels does not seem to affect these processes in PC-rich and PE-rich *Synechococcus* sp. Alternatively to non-photochemical quenching of excitation, picocyanobacteria can mediate pseudo-cyclic electron flows from PSII back to oxygen through multiple pathways [@grossmanPerspectivePhotosynthesisOligotrophic2010; @murphyPhotoinactivationPhotosystemII2017], thereby controlling feedback inhibition of electron transport and reducing the risk of reactive oxygen species production. 

The pattern of σ~PSII~, τ~PSII~, q~P~, or *JV*~PSII~ versus irradiance can be used to predict the light acclimation status of picocyanobacteria as suggested by @campbellPredictingLightAcclimation1996a. Oxygen is a product of photosynthesis but also have the potential to damage PSII protein subunits. The PsbA protein subunit of PSII is particularly susceptible to irreversible damage leading to the inactivation of the PSII complex [@anderssonPhotodamagePhotosystemII1992]. The oxygen evolving complex of PSII can be inactivated by a photon in the UV or blue range directly absorbed by the Mn~4~Ca cluster [@hakalaEvidenceRoleOxygenevolving2005]. Here, we showed that σ~PSII~ was low and shows little change with increasing actinic light during excitation through chlorophyll at Ex~445nm~ due the fact that in cyanobacteria the number of chlorophyll per PSII is low, and nearly fixed, so the effective absorption cross section for chlorophyll is also low  [@xuPhytoplanktonSPSIIExcitation2018]. τ~PSII~, was generally faster for both PC-rich and PE-rich strains under 250 µM [O~2~], consistent with the cyanobacterial capacity for electron transport away from PSII to [O~2~] [@campbellOxygendependentElectronFlow1999; @hughesRoadmapsDetoursActive2018], particularly under excess actinic light. As expected, q~P~ was generally higher for both PC-rich and PE-rich strains under 250 µM [O~2~], since cyanobacteria show strong capacity for electron flow away from PSII to O~2~, particularly under excess excitation [@campbellOxygendependentElectronFlow1999; @hughesRoadmapsDetoursActive2018].

Picocyanobacteria numerically dominate vast tracts of the world’s oceans and contribute a significant proportion of primary production, particularly in oligotrophic regions. The ecological success of picoplanktonic *Synechococcus*  suggests they possess sophisticated strategies to respond to variations in their environment. Indeed, it appears that it is the *in situ* community structure of picocyanobacteria which underlies this success, with the existence of specific ecotypes or lineages occupying different niches to populate the world’s oceans [@scanlanMarinePicocyanobacteria2012]. Hutchinson’s paradox of the plankton inspired many studies on the mechanisms of
species coexistence [@hutchinsonIntroductionPopulationEcology1978]. It is commonly believed that picocyanobacteria species can share the light spectrum by specializing in different wavelengths [@haverkampColorfulMicrodiversitySynechococcus2009a, @stompAdaptiveDivergencePigment2004a, @stompColourfulCoexistenceRed2007a]. Competition models and laboratory experiments have shown that PE-rich picocyanobacteria outperform competitors in green light and PC-rich picocyanobacteria dominate in red light, while both species coexist across the full spectrum [@stompAdaptiveDivergencePigment2004a; @stompColourfulCoexistenceRed2007a]. However, in our work, we find that not only the color of light, but also the oxygen concentration is a crucial determinant of growth rates across different *Synechococcus* sp., and that oxygen may drive different pigmentation phenotypes into different ecological niches.
