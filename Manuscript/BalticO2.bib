  abstract = {Electron transfer reactions among colored cytochromes in intact bacterial cells were monitored using an integrating cavity absorption meter that permitted the acquisition of accurate absorbance data in suspensions of cells that scatter light. The aerobic iron respiratory chain of Leptospirillum ferrooxidans was dominated by the redox status of an abundant cellular cytochrome that had an absorbance peak at 579\,nm in the reduced state. Intracellular cytochrome 579 was reduced within the time that it took to mix a suspension of the bacteria with soluble ferrous iron at pH 1.7. Steady state turnover experiments were conducted where the initial concentrations of ferrous iron were less than or equal to that of the oxygen concentration. Under these conditions, the initial absorbance spectrum of the bacterium observed under air-oxidized conditions was always regenerated from that of the bacterium observed in the presence of Fe(II). The kinetics of aerobic respiration on soluble iron by intact L. ferrooxidans conformed to the Michaelis--Menten formalism, where the reduced intracellular cytochrome 579 represented the Michaelis complex whose subsequent oxidation appeared to be the rate-limiting step in the overall aerobic respiratory process. The velocity of formation of ferric iron at any time point was directly proportional to the concentration of the reduced cytochrome 579. Further, the integral over time of the concentration of the reduced cytochrome was directly proportional to the total concentration of ferrous iron in each reaction mixture. These kinetic data obtained using whole cells were consistent with the hypothesis that reduced cytochrome 579 is an obligatory steady state intermediate in the iron respiratory chain of this bacterium. The capability of conducting visible spectroscopy in suspensions of intact cells comprises a powerful post-reductionist means to study cellular respiration in situ under physiological conditions for the organism.},

  abstract = {Photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry is the ultimate source of reducing power for phytoplankton primary productivity (PhytoPP). Single turnover active chlorophyll fluorometry (STAF) provides a non-intrusive method that has the potential to measure PhytoPP on much wider spatiotemporal scales than is possible with more direct methods such as 14C fixation and O2 evolved through water oxidation. Application of a STAF-derived absorption coefficient for PSII light-harvesting (aLHII) provides a method for estimating PSII photochemical flux on a unit volume basis (JVPII). Within this study, we assess potential errors in the calculation of JVPII arising from sources other than photochemically active PSII complexes (baseline fluorescence) and the package effect. Although our data show that such errors can be significant, we identify fluorescence-based correction procedures that can be used to minimize their impact. For baseline fluorescence, the correction incorporates an assumed consensus PSII photochemical efficiency for dark-adapted material. The error generated by the package effect can be minimized through the ratio of variable fluorescence measured within narrow wavebands centered at 730 nm, where the re-absorption of PSII fluorescence emission is minimal, and at 680 nm, where re-absorption of PSII fluorescence emission is maximal. We conclude that, with incorporation of these corrective steps, STAF can provide a reliable estimate of JVPII and, if used in conjunction with simultaneous satellite measurements of ocean color, could take us significantly closer to achieving the objective of obtaining reliable autonomous estimates of PhytoPP.},

  abstract = {Oxygen is fundamental to life. Not only is it essential for the survival of individual animals, but it regulates global cycles of major nutrients and carbon. The oxygen content of the open ocean and coastal waters has been declining for at least the past half-century, largely because of human activities that have increased global temperatures and nutrients discharged to coastal waters. These changes have accelerated consumption of oxygen by microbial respiration, reduced solubility of oxygen in water, and reduced the rate of oxygen resupply from the atmosphere to the ocean interior, with a wide range of biological and ecological consequences. Further research is needed to understand and predict long-term, global- and regional-scale oxygen changes and their effects on marine and estuarine fisheries and ecosystems.}

In a wide range of cyanobacteria and cyano-lichens, the easily measured fluorescence parameters, coefficient of nonphotochemical quenching of photosystem II variable fluorescence (qN) and nonphotochemical quenching, decline to a minimum near the acclimated growth light intensity. This characteristic pattern predicts the integrated light regime to which populations are acclimated, information that is particularly useful for cyanobacteria or cyano-lichens from habitats with highly variable light intensities. qN reflects processes that compete with photosystem II photochemistry for absorbed excitation energy. In cyanobacteria, we find no evidence for energy-dependent quenching mechanisms, which are the predominant components of qN in higher plants. Instead, in cyanobacteria, qN correlates closely with the excitation flow from the phycobilisome to photosystem I, indicating that qN reflects the state transition mechanism for equilibration of excitation from the phycobilisome to the two photosystems.}

At low photon flux densities, photosynthesis is a linear function of irradiance (E), the number of reaction centers (n), their effective absorption capture cross section (o), and a quantum yield (0) . As photosynthesis becomes increasingly light saturated, an increased fraction of reaction centers close. At light saturation the maximum photosynthetic rate is given as the product of the number o f reaction centers (n) and their maximum electron transport rate (1 It). Using active fluoromctry it is possible to measure non-destructively and in real time the fraction of open or closed reaction centers under ambient irradiance conditions in situ, as well as {$<$}7 and 0 . rcan be readily calculated from knowledge of the light saturation parameter, Ek (which can be deduced in situ by active fluorescence measurements) and a. We built a pump and probe fluorometer, which is interfaced with a CTD. The instrument measures the fluorescence yield of a weak probe flash preceding (F0) and succeeding (Fnl) a saturating pump flash. Profiles of these fluorescence yields are used to derive the instantaneous rate o f gross photosynthesis in natural phytoplankton communities without any incubation. Correlations with shortterm simulated in situ radiocarbon measurements are extremely high. The average slope between photosynthesis derived from fluorescence and that measured by radiocarbon is 1.06 and corresponds to the average photosynthetic quotient. The intercept is about 12\% of the maximum radiocarbon uptake and corresponds to the average net community respiration. Profiles of photosynthesis and sections showing the variability in its composite parameters reveal a significant effect of nutrient availability on photosynthetic energy conversion efficiency in the ocean, independent of phytoplankton species composition.},

Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry (FRRf) provides a potential means to realize this goal with unprecedented resolution and scale yet has not become the ``go-to'' method despite high expectations. A major obstacle is difficulty converting electron transfer rates to equivalent rates of C-fixation most relevant for studies of biogeochemical C-fluxes. Such difficulty stems from methodological inconsistencies and our limited understanding of how the electron requirement for C-fixation ({$\Phi$}e,C) is influenced by the environment and by differences in the composition and physiology of phytoplankton assemblages. We outline a ``roadmap'' for limiting methodological bias and to develop a more mechanistic understanding of the ecophysiology underlying {$\Phi$}e,C. We 1) re-evaluate core physiological processes governing how microalgae invest photosynthetic electron transport-derived energy and reductant into stored carbon versus alternative sinks. Then, we 2) outline steps to facilitate broader uptake and exploitation of FRRf, which could transform our knowledge of aquatic primary productivity. We argue it is time to 3) revise our historic methodological focus on carbon as the currency of choice, to 4) better appreciate that electron transport fundamentally drives ecosystem biogeochemistry, modulates cell-to-cell interactions, and ultimately modifies community biomass and structure.}

The FRR fluorescence technique applies a sequence of subsaturating excitation pulses (`flashlets') at microsecond intervals to induce fluorescence transients. This approach is extremely flexible and allows the generation of both single-turnover (ST) and multiple-turnover (MT) flashes. Using a combination of ST and MT flashes, we investigated the effect of excitation protocols on the measured fluorescence parameters. The maximum fluorescence yield induced by an ST flash applied shortly (10 {$\mu$}s to 5 ms) following an MT flash increased to a level comparable to that of an MT flash, while the functional absorption cross-section decreased by about 40\%. We interpret this phenomenon as evidence that an MT flash induces an increase in the fluorescence-rate constant, concomitant with a decrease in the photosynthetic-rate constant in PS II reaction centers. The simultaneous measurements of {$\sigma$}PS II, p, and the kinetics of Q-A reoxidation, which can be derived only from a combination of ST and MT flash fluorescence transients, permits robust characterization of the processes of photosynthetic energy-conversion.},

Special attention would be paid to algal species threatened by extinction, rare, en- demic, toxic, harmful or typical of our region. The growth of Baltic strains has been characterized by factorial experiment approach. The effects of salinity, light and temperature, as well as their interaction have been deter- mined. The brackishwater character showed: Chlorella vulgaris, Oocystis submarina, O. parva, Stichococcus bacillaris, Cyclotella meneghiniana, Skeletonema costatum, and Nodularia spumigena, cyanobacterium Phormidium amphibium was the marine strain and green algae from the genus Scenedesmus and Monoraphidium were freshwater strains. The growth of the above strains was strongly affected by light and temperature interaction. This effect was especially distinct in diatoms. However, the influence on the light alone was not so well-marked. For six strains: Monoraphidium convolutum, Amphora coffeaeformis, Entomoneis punctulata, Haslea spicula, Nitzschia thermaloides and the second strain of Skeletonema costatum only influence of salinity was investigated. It occurred that green alga was a typ- ically freshwater species, Skeletonema costatum showed marine character, however the re- maining strains were brackishwater.}

  abstract = {Phytoplankton primary productivity is most commonly measured by 14C assimilation although less direct methods, such as O2 exchange, have also been employed. These methods are invasive, requiring bottle incubation for up to 24 h. As an alternative, Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry (FRRf) has been used, on wide temporal and spatial scales within aquatic systems, to estimate photosystem II (PSII) electron flux per unit volume (JVPSII), which generally correlates well with photosynthetic O2 evolution. A major limitation of using FRRf arises from the need to employ an independent method to determine the concentration of functional photosystem II reaction centers ([RCII]); a requirement that has prevented FRR fluorometers being used, as stand-alone instruments, for the estimation of electron transport. Within this study, we have taken a new approach to the analysis of FRRf data, based on a simple hypothesis; that under a given set of environmental conditions, the ratio of rate constants for RCII fluorescence emission and photochemistry falls within a narrow range, for all groups of phytoplankton. We present a simple equation, derived from the established FRRf algorithm, for determining [RCII] from dark FRRf data alone. We also describe an entirely new algorithm for estimating JVPSII, which does not require determination of [RCII] and is valid for a heterogeneous model of connectivity among RCIIs. Empirical supporting evidence is presented. These data are derived from FRR measurements across a diverse range of microalgae, in parallel with independent measurements of [RCII]. Possible sources of error, particularly under nutrient stress conditions, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Vast expanses of oxygen-deficient and nitrite-rich water define the major oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) of the global ocean. They support diverse microbial communities that influence the nitrogen economy of the oceans, contributing to major losses of fixed nitrogen as dinitrogen (N2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases. Anaerobic microbial processes, including the two pathways of N2 production, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation, are oxygen-sensitive, with some occurring only under strictly anoxic conditions. The detection limit of the usual method (Winkler titrations) for measuring dissolved oxygen in seawater, however, is much too high to distinguish low oxygen conditions from true anoxia. However, new analytical technologies are revealing vanishingly low oxygen concentrations in nitrite-rich OMZs, indicating that these OMZs are essentially anoxic marine zones (AMZs). Autonomous monitoring platforms also reveal previously unrecognized episodic intrusions of oxygen into the AMZ core, which could periodically support aerobic metabolisms in a typically anoxic environment. Although nitrogen cycling is considered to dominate the microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of AMZs, recent environmental genomics and geochemical studies show the presence of other relevant processes, particularly those associated with the sulfur and carbon cycles. AMZs correspond to an intermediate state between two ``end points'' represented by fully oxic systems and fully sulfidic systems. Modern and ancient AMZs and sulfidic basins are chemically and functionally related. Global change is affecting the magnitude of biogeochemical fluxes and ocean chemical inventories, leading to shifts in AMZ chemistry and biology that are likely to continue well into the future.}

  abstract = {So far, every example in this book has started with a nice dataset that's easy to plot. That's great for learning (because you don't want to struggle with data handling while you're learning visualisation), but in real life, datasets hardly ever come in exactly the right structure. To use ggplot2 in practice, you'll need to learn some data wrangling skills. Indeed, in my experience, visualisation is often the easiest part of the data analysis process: once you have the right data, in the right format, aggregated in the right way, the right visualisation is often obvious.},

  abstract = {Environmental toxicology focuses on identifying and predicting impact of potentially toxic anthropogenic chemicals on biosphere at various levels of biological organization. Presently there is a significant drive to gain deeper understanding of cellular and sub-cellular mechanisms of ecotoxicity. Most notable is increased focus on elucidation of cellular-response networks, interactomes, and greater implementation of cell-based biotests using high-throughput procedures, while at the same time decreasing the reliance on standard animal models used in ecotoxicity testing. This is aimed at discovery and interpretation of molecular pathways of ecotoxicity at large scale. In this regard, the applications of cytometry are perhaps one of the most fundamental prospective analytical tools for the next generation and high-throughput ecotoxicology research. The diversity of this modern technology spans flow, laser-scanning, imaging, and more recently, Raman as well as mass cytometry. The cornerstone advantages of cytometry include the possibility of multi-parameter measurements, gating and rapid analysis. Cytometry overcomes, thus, limitations of traditional bulk techniques such as spectrophotometry or gel-based techniques that average the results from pooled cell populations or small model organisms. Novel technologies such as cell imaging in flow, laser scanning cytometry, as well as mass cytometry provide innovative and tremendously powerful capabilities to analyze cells, tissues as well as to perform in situ analysis of small model organisms. In this review, we outline cytometry as a tremendously diverse field that is still vastly underutilized and often largely unknown in environmental sciences. The main motivation of this work is to highlight the potential and wide-reaching applications of cytometry in ecotoxicology, guide environmental scientists in the technological aspects as well as popularize its broader adoption in environmental risk assessment.},

  abstract = {It is commonly known that phytoplankton have a pivotal role in marine biogeochemistry and ecosystems as carbon fixers and oxygen producers, but their response to deoxygenation has scarcely been studied. Nonetheless, in the major oceanic oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), all surface phytoplankton groups, regardless of size, disappear and are replaced by unique cyanobacteria lineages below the oxycline. To develop reasonable hypotheses to explain this pattern, we conduct a review of available information on OMZ phytoplankton, and we re-analyze previously published data (flow cytometric and hydrographic) on vertical structure of phytoplankton communities in relation to light and O2 levels. We also review the physical constraints on O2 acquisition as well as O2-dependent metabolisms in phototrophs. These considerations, along with estimates of the photosynthetic capacity of phytoplankton along OMZ depth profiles using published data, suggest that top-down grazing, respiratory demand, and irradiance are insufficient to fully explain the vertical structure observed in the upper, more sunlit portions of OMZs. Photorespiration and water--water cycles are O2-dependent pathways with low O2 affinities. Although their metabolic roles are still poorly understood, a hypothetical dependence on such pathways by the phytoplankton adapted to the oxic ocean might explain vertical patterns in OMZs and results of laboratory experiments. This can be represented in a simple model in which the requirement for photorespiration in surface phytoplankton and O2-inhibition of OMZ lineages reproduces the observed vertical fluorescence profiles and the replacement of phytoplankton adapted to O2 by lineages restricted to the most O2-deficient waters. A high O2 requirement by modern phytoplankton would suggest a positive feedback that intensifies trends in OMZ extent and ocean oxygenation or deoxygenation, both in Earth's past and in response to current climate change.},

  abstract = {Fast Repetition and Relaxation chlorophyll fluorescence induction is used to estimate the effective absorption cross section of PSII ({$\sigma$}PSII), to analyze phytoplankton acclimation and electron transport. The fitting coefficient {$\rho$} measures excitation transfer from closed PSII to remaining open PSII upon illumination, which could theoretically generate a progressive increase in {$\sigma$}PSII for the remaining open PSII. To investigate how {$\rho$} responds to illumination we grew marine phytoplankters with diverse antenna structures (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, Ostreococcus and Thalassiosira pseudonana) under limiting or saturating growth light. Initial {$\rho$} varied with growth light in Synechococcus and Thalassiosira. With increasing actinic illumination PSII closed progressively and {$\rho$} decreased for all four taxa, in a pattern explicable as an exponential decay of {$\rho$} with increasing distance between remaining open PSII reaction centers. This light-dependent down-regulation of {$\rho$} allows the four phytoplankters to limit the effect of increasing light upon {$\sigma$}PSII. The four structurally distinct taxa showed, however, distinct rates of response of {$\rho$} to PSII closure, likely reflecting differences in the spacing or orientation among their PSII centers. Following saturating illumination recovery of {$\rho$} in darkness coincided directly with PSII re-opening in Prochlorococcus. Even after PSII had re-opened in Synechococcus a transition to State II slowed dark recovery of {$\rho$}. In Ostreococcus sustained NPQ slowed dark recovery of {$\rho$}. In Thalassiosira dark recovery of {$\rho$} was slowed, possibly by a light-induced change in PSII spacing. These patterns of {$\rho$} versus PSII closure are thus a convenient probe of comparative PSII spacings.},
